# Kmeans-Clustering

* We implemented Kmeans Lloyd, Kmeans++ using MapReduce with PySpark.
* We also implemented a variation of Kmeans that is Kmeans||. 
* We benchmarked performance of Kmeans Lloyd, Kmeans++, and Kmeans||, all implemented with PySpark, against a weather dataset with 15000 entries.

Presentation and research related to this algorithm are also included.
