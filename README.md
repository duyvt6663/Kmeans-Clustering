# Kmeans-Clustering
An implementation of the famous Kmeans and Kmeans++.  

* As a bonus, we also implement a variation of Kmeans that is Kmeans|| using PySpark. 
* We benchmarked performance of Kmeans Lloyd, Kmeans++, and Kmeans||, all implemented with PySpark, against a weather dataset with 15000 entries.
* The result might not be consistent.

Presentation and research related to this algorithm are also included.
